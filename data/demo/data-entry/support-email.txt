Subject: URGENT: Order #ORD-99234 - Wrong item received
Date: Mon, 14 Jul 2025 09:32:10 -0500

Hi Support,

I received my order ORD-99234 yesterday but the item doesn't match what I ordered. I ordered "Model Z Thermal Battery" (SKU: Z-TH-2024), but the box contains "Model Y Battery" instead. The order was placed under Olivia Turner / olivia.turner@example.com / (555) 321-9876.

Please advise on return shipping and replacement. My address is:
Olivia Turner
742 Evergreen Terrace
Apt 5B
Springfield, IL 62704

This contains my order number and personal info â€” please redact before sending to external systems.

Thanks,
Olivia
